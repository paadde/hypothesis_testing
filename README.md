# HYPOTHESIS TESTING FOR FAST FOOD MARKETING CAMPAIGN
A fast-food chain is launching a new menu item and wants to determine the most effective marketing campaign to promote it. Three different promotions are tested in randomly selected markets, and weekly sales data is collected for four weeks. This project will use hypothesis testing to analyze the sales data and determine if there is a significant difference in sales performance between the three marketing campaigns. The findings will help the fast-food chain make informed decisions about their marketing strategy and maximize sales for the new product.
